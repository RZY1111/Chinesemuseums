This data set consists of three parts, namely museum annual reports, information on precious cultural relics, museum exhibitions and news.  

The three parts of data come from the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of China and the China Museum Association.  

Precious cultural relic information cannot be uploaded to github due to the large amount of data.
